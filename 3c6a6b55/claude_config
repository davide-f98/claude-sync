The issue where EBITDA is 0 in Python but has a value in SAS (e.g., for\n  id_soggetto 878882) strongly suggests a difference in how missing values (NaN) are handled during\n  arithmetic operations.\n\n  In SAS, if you sum a series of columns and one of them is missing, it is treated as 0. In pandas, the\n  default behavior is that any operation involving NaN results in NaN.\n\n  To fix this, I will modify the calculate_financial_ratios function in utilities_1.py to explicitly\n  fill NaN values with 0 before performing the calculations, perfectly replicating the SAS behavior.\n",
