The Windows PC has group policy restrictions and no admin rights, so the solution must work without administrator privileges.\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe existing claude-sync project (https://github.com/shaike1/claude-sync) has several issues:\n- Incorrect directory paths\n- Doesn't work on Windows (uses PowerShell)\n- Creates duplicate sections in CLAUDE.md file\n- Poor merge function implementation\n- Uses CC slash commands instead of direct terminal commands\n\n## Requirements\n1. **Repository Name**: \"sync-claude\" \n2. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Must work on both macOS and Windows\n3. **No admin rights required**: Must work within Windows group policy restrictions\n4. **GitHub-based synchronization**: Use GitHub as the sync backend\n5. **Documentation**: Include PLAN.md and PROGRESS.md files for tracking setup progress across devices\n\n## Technical Specifications\n- **macOS**: Use default terminal (zsh)\n- **Windows**: Use PowerShell commands\n- **Path handling**: Proper cross-platform path resolution\n- **File merging**: Intelligent merge strategy to avoid duplicate sections in CLAUDE.md\n- **Terminal commands**: Use direct terminal commands instead of CC slash commands\n- **Configuration files**: Sync all CC configuration files and settings\n\n## Key Features to Implement\n1. **Path Detection**: Automatically detect CC installation paths on both platforms\n2. **Platform Detection**: Detect operating system and use appropriate commands\n3. **File Synchronization**: Sync configuration files, settings, and CLAUDE.md\n4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle merge conflicts intelligently\n5. **Progress Tracking**: Use PLAN.md and PROGRESS.md for cross-device coordination\n\n## Expected Output\nCreate a complete, working solution that:\n- Works on both macOS and Windows without admin rights\n- Uses GitHub for synchronization\n- Has proper file merging without duplicates\n- Uses terminal commands instead of slash commands\n- Includes comprehensive documentation (PLAN.md, PROGRESS.md)\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Start by creating the GitHub repository structure\n- Take inspiration from the previosly cited project but be carefull: its code contains a lot of issues\n- Implement platform-specific scripts for macOS and Windows\n- Create intelligent file merging logic\n- Add proper error handling and logging\n- Include setup instructions for both platforms\n- Claude Code sessions used to implement this project on the two machines should always read and update the PROGRESS.md file"},"uuid":"890ea16c-1a8d-4961-9717-f69f540888b1","timestamp":"2025-08-07T17:49:37.326Z"}
